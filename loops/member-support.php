<h3>Photo Galleries</h3>

<p>You can upload photo galleries to your business page quickly and easily. To do so, first gather up your photos (you can have up to 10 at a time). It's best if images are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>.JPG, .GIF, or .PNG format</li>
	<li>Around 400kb or less in file size (there is a max file size of 2mb, but those take a while to download!)
</li>
<h4>Adding Photos</h4>
<p>To create a gallery and add photos:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Log in and click to edit your page</li>
	<li>Scroll to the bottom, and click on 'Add a Photo' button under the Photo Gallery heading</li>
	<li>In the new field that appeared, click on the 'Add Image' button</li>
	<li>Drag and drop your photos or click the 'Select Files' button to upload new photos (you can also click on the 'Media Library' tab at the top to toggle to photos you've previously uploaded)</li>
	<li>After the image has uploaded, click on the 'Select Image' button on the lower right hand corner</li>
	<li>After clicking the 'Select Image' button, you can give your image a caption (optional)</li>
	<li>To upload additional photos, repeat steps 1-6</li>
	<li>Once all your desired photos are uploaded, you can reorder them &mdash; click on a number next to a photo and drag them up or down to reorder</li>
</ol>
<h4>Editing an Existing Gallery</h4>
<p>If you have a gallery already created, you can remove older images and upload new ones.</p>
<p>To remove images:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Hover over the row that contains the image you would like to remove</li>
	<li>A (-) sign appears to the right &mdash; click it to remove the image</li>

</ol>

<h3>Promotions</h3>

<h4>What is a Promotion?</h4>
<p>A promotion is really just an offering or sales announcement your company might be running. If you were a pizzeria for example, you could be running a promotion for $10 plain pizzas on Mondays.</p>
<p>Promotions can include the following info:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A title</li>
	<li>Details (a paragraph of copy)</li>
	<li>Link</li>
	<li>Banner Ad (300 x 250 pixel image)</li>
</ul>
<p>The banner ad is optional. If you provide it, it puts your banner ad into the general rotation of banner ads across the site.</p>

<h4>Adding a Promotion</h4>
<p>To add a promotion:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Log in and click to edit your page</li>
	<li>Scroll to the bottom, and click on 'Add a Promotion' button under the Promotions heading</li>
	<li>Add your title, details, and link, and banner ad if you have it (you can always go in and edit or add stuff later)</li>
	<li>Click the update button to save your page</li>
</ol>
<p>You can always take a look at all of the promotions you have running on the <a href="?content-promotions">member dashboard</a>.</p>

<h3>Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</h3>

<h4>What is a SEO?</h4>
<p>SEO is the practice of optimizing your website copy so that Google and other search engines match up user searches to your pages.</p>
<p>SEO is a complex process with many nuances. However, there are three basic tags that you can use on your business' page:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Title Tag</strong> This is the title of a page, ideally your business name and main focus. Something like, 'Pickel Web Design | Custom Web Development'</li>
	<li><strong>Description Tag</strong> This is a short 1-2 sentences that is an elevator pitch of your company. It appears on google search results as the copy that is shown to entice readers to click that particular search result.</li>
	<li><strong>Keywords</strong> These are topics your company is about. Something like 'Web Design, Web Development, Ardmore, Custom Graphic Design'</li>
</ul>
<p>It is also helpful to continue using these keywords in your company description.</p>

<h4>Updating Your SEO Tags</h4>
<p>To update your SEO tags:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Log in and click to edit your page</li>
	<li>Scroll to the bottom, and enter your preferred Title, Description, and Keyword tags</li>
	<li>Click the update button to save your page</li>
</ol>
